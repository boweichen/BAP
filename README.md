### Overview

This repository provides supplementary materials for the book [Business Analytics with Python: Essential Skills for Business Students](https://www.koganpage.com/business-and-management/business-analytics-with-python-9781398617179):

-	The `data` folder contains the datasets used throughout the book.
-	The ` python_source_files` folder includes example scripts and exercise solutions.

### Notes

-	Every effort has been made to minimise errors and typographical mistakes in the book, although some may remain. If you identify any, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
-	The examples and solutions provided are illustrative rather than prescriptive â€” they demonstrate one possible approach to analysis, which may not always represent best practice. The aim is to provide clear and accessible guidance for implementing the models and algorithms introduced in the book using Python.
-	This repository will be updated periodically to reflect evolving practices and new developments in the field.
